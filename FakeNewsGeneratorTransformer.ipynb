            " vehicle, and said, referring to the police investigation into the girl's disappearance, \"There is no way that the car can have been moved there by the girl's mother, who did not appear in court and the girl herself did not speak to any family member.\" On her brother's identity, the girl's mother told the court, \"He is not in police custody and his house has been searched without a warrant by the social services office and we have no information regarding him.\" The girl's mother also told the court that she does not know the exact situation of her child and that she does not know what will happen to her or her siblings when she goes to visit her mother in Sajaur. A police spokesperson stated that she went to look for the child at midnight when she saw the black Toyota camry stopped just outside of the area and that the police immediately seized two other cars that were traveling in the same direction. The police did not detain the girl's mother during the search of the area where the car was stopped, she also told the press. The mother of the girl reported to the police that she was sleeping at her home in the direction of the area where she heard a loud crash and that she turned on her bedside lamp to look for her daughter. She found her daughter, lying face up in a pond, nude and with the front side up. The girl's mother remained silent for the remainder of the press conference, which lasted eight minutes, when asked if she understood the arrest of her daughter. However, the mother of the one-year-old girl, who has been living with the elderly woman for the last three years, did not hesitate to deny the allegations made by the police when questioned as to her daughter's condition. In a conversation with a public relations firm, she was asked whether her daughter had any injuries and the reply came that she could not confirm this because she did not \"have access\" to the house where the girl lived with her mother. However, when she went to call the mother, whom she did not know, she was told that the mother had entered the house, but could not give her daughter's age. According to the social worker who intervened at the house where the girl's mother lived with her, the girl's mother \"was not very present\" in the house during the last weeks she had been there. At her daughter's house the social worker observed some signs of violence against her, such as putting a knife to her head, being punched in the stomach, and her hair was standing up. The house neighbors were not pleased with the police action, but at the same time it provoked them to criticize the social worker, which they did. The neighbor of the house where the investigation took place said that the Social Workers \"had some problems\" during her visits there and that she was \"a good-looking woman with a bright head.\" The neighbor also claimed that the Social Workers \"had some problems as well\", since they \"they tried to enter\" the home. According to the source, the Social Workers \"had some problems\" when visiting the house in question in order to investigate the conditions of the girl's mother and \"there was aggression on the Social Workers.\" \" They entered her apartment, tore down the entry, and went through the bedroom.\" She also claimed that when she went to search for her daughter one afternoon her daughter was lying naked on a bridge by the pond. Despite these accusations, the neighbors of the house where the girl's mother lived with her with whom she went to look for her daughter were completely opposed to the police action, especially since it provoked them to criticize the agency that their neighbors had \"suspicions.\" The neighbors of the neighborhood \"had some problems\" with what they saw in their front yard and the neighbor of the house where the investigation took place with whom they went on the pretext of examining her \"aggressions,\" the neighbor of the same name. It should be pointed out that the neighbor of the house in which the investigation was carried out did not refuse to allow the Social Workers in, but that she did not give them permission to enter the house and that she was \"a good-looking woman\" and that she had a \"bright head.\" There was no way of knowing whether the neighbors of the residence where the investigation took place would have supported the official account when it was released by the police. However, the Social Workers, who were trying to check the status of the girl, turned to the neighbor of the house. When the Social Workers approached her, she did what she could to defend her daughter and she was \"physically assaulted\" by the Social Workers and had to tell what she knew of her daughter. In any case, the Social Workers left without asking anything about the girl. Meanwhile, after the arrest of the older girl's other brother, the police were searching for another black Toyota Camry that was going in the same direction. They found the car only after getting into custody the same individual who they had arrested earlier. Both youths were detained while they were still having\n",

The situation in Venezuela \"is one of catastrophe\", he stressed. \"There are signs that things may be changing, but the situation is not under control...

A 71-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the death of a 66-year-old man who fell about five kilometers from a bridge over the Rivera in the Islas Malvinas sector, according to a report from the Ministry of the Interior of the Canary Islands. The arrestee, a resident of Arguineguín, is described as a \"local man in work\" and, according to the report, he had traveled to Islas Malvinas to obtain natural gas. The arrestee was hospitalized in a good health and is expected to speak to reporters when he is brought before the legal procedures.

In addition, the organism recovered from the dead man includes an anthropological and a DNA sample. In addition to the dead man, two other persons of similar age were found clinging to the steps of a different building, one of them with a gunshot wound to the head, while the third person suffered minor wounds. Investigation to extract the DNA samples Attempts to extract the DNA of the deceased man are made up of anthropological, genetic and medical sources, as well as municipal services in Islas Malvinas. In addition to the building with which he was associated, the local resident was also interested in obtaining natural gas from the Andalusian provider, but he did not do so because of the cost involved. From whence he got the gas he was not sure, but he assumed that it was delivered by the company ViaCaribe .

The Canary Islands and Cuba have signed an agreement under which the latter will provide with its own Navigation Satellite services both the archipelago's coasts and the interior of Cuba, in a first step toward cooperation in this field. \"This is the first step in contributing to the development of complementary services ,\" declared the Minister of the Navy of the Canary Islands, Martin Perez, to the La Republica de La República. The agreement, which refers to the establishment of a single system of navigation for the islands, will lay the foundations for cooperation in this field in the future, he added. The satellite launch Panamanian space center Telde will be linked to this system, launched on a Panamanian rocket on a 10th birthday launch, by means of an electronic transponder that transmits coordinates of the satellite to the ground. This will enable the owner of the property to be updated with the position of the launch site, as well as to specify the precise route to and from it. The local government of Gran Canaria will also be notified of this cooperation in the near future, and Panamanian officials indicated that they expect it to yield many advantages, such as facilitating the assignment of automatic transponders, since they are already sent from space, \"as well as from the air, with the procedure of connecting commercial air traffic with it\".

A 25-year-old Paraguayan man has been sentenced to 5 years in prison for raping a minor in southern Spain more than a year ago. The judge in this case gave the defendant a five-year suspended prison sentence, which must be extended by another one year, in line with the aggravating circumstance of a rape committed with violence. The judge noted that the defendant had acknowledged his guilt at the hearing and had been \"pleased\" with the sentence, which \"remains unchanged\" from the one given at a previous hearing. The judge regretted that the prosecution had not sought a shorter sentence, since the defendant had presented \"clear and convincing evidence of innocence\", at the hearing at which he was tried at the Xochimilco prefecture court, where the sentence was pronounced. The defendant Méndez Vives committed the crime, according to the indictment, when he contacted the memory of the minor, who was under his protection from the time she met him at a bar in González when she was a student at the University of Gran Canaria, and whom he traveled to Spain to live with her father in Almería. The victim had gone to live with her mother in Gran Canaria when he returned from Spain, and he cared for her until he was 16 years old, when he returned to live with his father in Arrecife, where they had several problems. At the time of the crime, the accused was unemployed and had several small debts, and he always regretted having committed the crime. CHECK MORE NEWS FROM LAS PALMAS HERE. In Cruz.

            " not to worry but to feel proud of them because this is the first time that a female politician from the project has taken part in the race during which the minimum age is raised from 16 to 25 years old ... The Minister of the Environment, Cristina Narbona, announced that she would raise the age of majority in the State from 16 to 25 years old for the first time, and that this decision would be taken at the High Level Meeting of the Leaders of the Community on Sustainable Development that will be held from 22 to 25 of November in Taormina, Sicily. The initiative announced is to discuss at that event options to be considered in this direction, both administrative and legal, in the context of creating a legal age of majority. The AGdiM, which represents the municipalities of Arucas, Izquierda and in the capital, Annibal B. Veigarrens, welcomed the news that the government would raise the legal age of majority in the State from 16 to 25 years old, which it considers to be a good regulation, based on experience, of marriage and family formation. The increase in the minimum age of marriage for women from 16 to 25 years old, which was instituted in 2008, has had the opposite effect, although there has been a diminution of the number of matricides. According to the study conducted by Telde, the number of matricides has almost doubled, from 3,011 in 2008 to 5,929 in 2012. Moreover, according to the survey carried out on Lampedusa City Councilors in June, after the hike in the minimum age of marriage, satisfaction with the work permit the city does issue has gone down from 78% to 62%. Simeon Diaz, the president of the United Left Coalition, welcomed the announcement by the State that starting this year marriages will be recognized by the Ministry of the Environment by sign language in order to prevent women who are not able to sign it loss of time lost because of the expense of obtaining a legal document in order to carry out a marriage in which one does not speak the language understood by the court interpreter.

The study by insurance company, AY, has found that the presence of such facilities on the territory of EU and Spanish states has created \"an official network of the eyes of the law\" that collects data on every step of the financial transaction and that uses technology to discover patterns \". 44 in 100 consumers who chose the option of 'nothing' when applying for a loan chose to pay by check, compared to 23% who chose this route when opening a bank account and 9% who went with the alternative of using a credit or debit card.

Use of a credit or an AMEX card was preferred by almost twice as many as using an AMEX card, and the second most common method of using a credit or an AMEX card was to buy things with cash, which had been used by only 6.5%. To avoid being detected, some 62% of those who cheated did so by using some other means, such as using a third country payment system, using a proxy, withdrawing money from overseas or transferring it by air. 39% of those who did this converted the items they bought using black sites facilities into euros, which forced the authorities to add to the budget of the Rajin de Iar Lenca (Red Letter Services) facility located in Girona to house 1,200 immigrants, which opened only a few\n",

            " rescue, authorities said. The boat was en route to Puerto Rico when it ran out of fuel and was stopped by the Coast Guard, officials said. The crew of 24 people, mostly Haitian, worked on getting the boat to shore so that it could be rescued, officials said. The captain was unhurt and the crew was able to make the transfer to Puerto Rico, where they were transferred to the Port of Gran Canaria, officials said. Blasted out of the sky by the event, the ROV was sighted moments later at the head of the Aosta Canal, about seven kilometers away. The vessel was traveling at full speed and was forced to stop several hundred meters from the shore, after which the crew of one of the gypsum boats that operates there was able to bring it to a halt about ten meters from the surface, after which two members of the Haitian Red Cross Society were able to take control of the rescue operations, officials said. The Red Cross representative was in contact with the occupants of the boat that made the first attempt to reach the island of Gran Canaria by sea on February 12, 2016, and the latest contact was made on that day with the last mobile number reported to be in the air. In an attempt to reach February 15, members of the Red Cross Society assisted in taking control of a small fishing boat in which four nationals of Haiti were traveling in the early morning twilight, authorities said. The boat was rescued from the sea and her occupants transferred to the Pérez Galdós Municipal Detention Facility, where they are awaiting deportation proceedings, according to the Haitian National Police. IN PICTURES: Santorini explosion GRAPHIC: EFE 1 witness See here how a natural disaster like this one is covered up in the Republic. That is why it is so important that the people become aware of how this horrible event is covered up in Santorini and around the Mediterranean coast.

This initiative was initiated by the Government of the Canary Islands in order to encourage more international participation at the U.N. climate change talks, especially at a conference like this where the chances for surprise are greatest. With over 400 countries and more than 120 economies and medium and large organizations, the U.N. climate change conference will be the largest international gathering on environmental problems and the fourth international climate change meeting in which over 320 participants will be represented. The aim of this initiative, which is not to call for protest, but to mobilize the international community to take concrete measures, is to favor the development of smart practices by all sectors, to put an end to the \"waste, fraud and inefficiency\" of the past and to contribute to the development of a resilient and environmentally friendly society. see HERE more NEWS FROM LAS PALMAS.

            " the island of Lampedusa, which was invaded by black slugs (Chloridiaspis) between July 1 and Sept. 30 of last year. These extremely large arthropods can reach a length of 8.5 centimeters and are distinguished by their black dots on the sides of the body and the opening of the mouth. These arthropods feed mainly on the stems of twigs and twigs of cypress. If the arthropods of the family Pterostomidae are added to the mix, the species constitutes the largest of the seven species of the family Pterostomidae found in the world. Developing country Victims of the infestation are exposed to extremely high humidity, extremely cold temperatures and intense winds, all of which inhibit the growth of certain microorganisms. Furthermore, the toxins in the aftertaste of the drug can cause serious injuries. The drug is metabolized by the endocannabinoid system, resulting in the de novo generation of endogenous cannabinoids, and finally it ischemia or cessation of the circulation of blood to the body, modulating the temperature without changing its core body temperature. The elimination half-life of the drug is 1.5 hours and, in mammals, it is excreted in the urine. OUTLAW Anthony Bourdain stops in Provincia de Gran Canaria to negotiate the sale of its crop to satisfy the demand from McDonald's and other restaurants that the Caribbean island has been infected by the sloth. The Venezuelan businessman has purchased the lease of the land in the south of the island from a Venezuelan company for 35,000 euros, a price that grew with each disclosure of the presence of the sloth in the newspapers. The discovery of the crop caused a sensation in the capital of Venezuela, with the appointment of a meeting of Venezuela's Ministers of Agriculture and of Livestock to explore all the possible economic and social uses of the abundant natural resources. A memorandum of understanding was also signed with the Companyotti family, which will allow the resumption of the transfer of cattle from the Venezuelan Amazon to the island. A visit to the Mellanoys, the present owners of the spice merchant's store at the intersection of Avenida de Gran Canaria and Pérez Galdós, revealed that the crop had been germinated in the canals by the volcanic activity in the area. According to the secretary of the ministry, the crop could be harvested in three months or sixty days, depending on the latitude and the cultivar of the palm. The official also noted that the crop would benefit the economy of the island, as the palm tree will be a net importer and a good source of revenue for the state.

The Minister of Agriculture of the Canary Islands, José Manuel Soria, has notified that the berry Poffina will be included in the next regional programme \"Firm Programme for the Production, Marketing and Sales of Berries of the Tropic of Our Lady of Lourdes\". The announcement was made at a reception given by the same name organized by the Ministries of Food, Tourism and Fisheries of the Canarian Government. The ministers considered that these initiatives will promote the tourism of the Canary Islands and enhance the competitiveness of the industry. The launch of this new initiative, which will cover only part of the Tropic of Our Lady of Lourdes, is intended to counter the ban on the sale of fruit from this religious place of worship in the Cantabria and Sicily. The supermarkets in these three Minorities-populated areas continue to stock fruit from the grove of palms belonging to the Claria Nevado in Miguel Pérez Arteaga's honor, despite the fact that the Minister had to pay 35,000 euros to the family of 33 years, which lost his job after he protested the confiscation. The Minister used an opportunity to promote the initiative, giving a press conference in which he announced that Inmer De Lima, the daughter of La Isleta de Lisboa, will get the first right to market herself as a result of the announcement. This will be accomplished by having her dad as the head of a company dedicated to the production and marketing of Berries of the Tropic of Our Lady of Lourdes. The De Ligas family, which has three generations of the family business in the Cabello department store, made many investments in the tourism of the region, with several long-term contracts with major tourism companies in the area. The announcement that her family will be the first in the area to launch a retail venture out of the produce of the Tropic of Our Lady of Lourdes after the signing of a long-term contract with As.

Both the subjects aged 18 and 20 years old and one very minor were arrested and are now preparing their evidence before the courts in Arrecife. The investigation As a rule, if the sexual abuse takes place after the fact it is considered not proven because the accused person did not have to agree to it or he/she would not have done it. However, in this case the defendant does not exist in the case and the evidence gathered during the investigation leads to the conclusion that it was he who acted inappropriately and not the other way around.

The court of First Instance will have to decide whether to grant a youth prison sentence of three months or the possibility to repeat it. The court of Appeal will have to act differently, since the youth committed an aggravated misdemeanor and not a crime of moral turpitude. According to the prosecutor, the young man, who cannot be identified since the court order is still valid, told a friend what had happened and the two went to the supermarket to buy bread. When they returned, the young man found himself face to face with the teacher Luís Cecilia Oqueda, 30 years old and with whom he had engaged in sexual intercourse approximately 10 minutes before. The young man told what happened after exiting the store and going to a field where he found himself face to face with Cecilia. The young man told what happened then that he had gone to the field to buy bread and then got separated from the other people who were having the same experience. They all went to the same spot where the other man, who he did not know, was standing guard by the fence. After Cecilia had finished having sexual intercourse with the young man, he ran away and when she followed him she found her fainting mother. 48-year-old Natalia Zina and the mother of the young man, who is in a serious condition, who is in a stable condition. Zina had returned to the estate where the women lived after buying a can of beer and when she went to get another one she found a note from the young man begging her to give it to her husband, so she gave it to her and she knows that it is not a lie. Zina opens the note and she says that she has read in it: \"I have problems, please help. I have no money, I have no food, I have no clothes, please.\" Zina asks if she has any other preconditions and the note says that she does not and asks if she has any intention of using her when there is bread in sight for herself and five other people who are homeless. The note adds that she has no intention of telling anyone and that she thinks it is a lie because she does not have children and because she does not want anyone to suffer what she has gone through. Zina hands over the note to an inspector and she reads in the document that the amount owed is 1500 euros and that the deadline for fulfilling the conditions of the agreement is next Tuesday. The court will decide if the sentence is to be suspended or if it is to be commuted to a youth prison. CHECK MORE NEWS FROM LAS PALMAS HERE.

This formula was also followed in Arrecife, where, following the votes of the First Council, the same group of representatives chose a platform in which to put forward its program. The system is a hybrid one, with the election of a council composed of multiple bodies, each with its own set of priorities and means to execute them. This has been the case in Arrecife, where the votes of the First Council produced three executive positions, creating a \"hierarchy of power\" with \"total executive control,\" as the PIR report stressed. The advisory council, which has delegated a specific task to the councilor, has exercised this role to negotiate the buy-back program with private sellers; to approve the purchase plans for the creation of housing; and to approve planning controls at the ports of its jurisdiction. From the beginning, the PIR saw that these powers had been used in a way that \"restricted the right to sell and to buy a share, transferred costs to consumers, interfered with competition and waste of public money.\" In its turn, the voting public has expressed \"serious doubts\" with regard to the suitability of the three posts, since \"they want to reduce the powers of the First Councilors and of the Advisory Council, which they accuse of being too much executive in nature.\" In addition, the voting public has \"serious reservations\" about the guarantee of paid employment, since these powers have been put in place \"to fire the heads of departments and to replace them with their own people.\" Finally, the voting public has \"serious reservations\" about the promotion of companies in the islands\n",

            " agents that took part and the number of arrests\". \"What makes this case different from the other ones is that this is a case of attempted murder, and the ringleader of the gang is an adult male, between 18 and 25 years old, with a medium build, wearing a sweater and wearing a ring around his middle\", emphasizes a statement from the Observatory of Surveillance for Endangered Narcotics. The arrest warrant was issued by the Beja Sanchez range police office, in collaboration with the Institution of Criminal Protection under the Ministry of the Interior, and the arrest warrant is valid from today until 29 April. Individuals at the time of the arrest shared that they were early enough in the morning to grab a towel and roll in mud, since they did not expect to encounter so many law enforcement agents at once. As a result of this situation, some of the people at the beach took off their clothes, while others swam in the water to avoid being seen. As for the structure of the home, which is approximately 12 meters by 8 meters, with a floorpace of 25.7 square meters, the pictures show that it is equipped with a garage, a living/dining area with private foyer, an open plan master bedroom, bathrooms, study/study area, a bathroom with no return route, and a deck with a verandah with a window on one side. Additional vigilance The Bolivian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Food stresses that \"there is no evidence that diet influenced the actions or thoughts of the authors, only that they acted in a way that alarmed others.\" They also emphasize that \"all the elements were in agreement to produce hysteria\" A report on the content and intention of the articles will be presented to the Government representatives, so that \"the Bolivian authorities can take necessary measures to prevent a similar situation from developing in their country.\", reports the news agency.

The body of Yulisa Pérez, found dead yesterday in Lanzarote, does not show signs of sexual abuse, police sources reported, who see no signs that her stepfather is guilty of her death despite the outcry that the case is raising in her community. The autopsy, carried out yesterday on the young woman, reveals that she died of suffocation and, apart from the hands tied behind her back, does not show other signs of violence, beatings or signs of sexual abuse, added Commissioner Antonio Fernández. Yulisa's stepfather, in danger On the other hand, the young woman's stepfather is still in the Arrecife police station to be protected, as he is in danger of lynching, since the young woman's relatives and her friends point him out as guilty. The sources stressed that the man has never been to the Police Station because of the risk of being lynched, and that his relatives tried to get him to turn himself, but he refused to go. The man's situation is extremely complicated, the sources explained, since he is accused of having sex with the young woman at the Alhambra hotel in Lanzarote a year or so ago, and since he has never been to the Police Station to be tried, let alone lynched. Therefore, the Court will have to decide whether to order the arrest of the man or grant him the opportunity to be tried at the Constitutional Court. Should the man be tried at the Court of Justice of the Federal District, he will most probably succeed, as the case of Yulisa indicates, in evading the penalties of the crime, which carry a life sentence, and since the man's relatives fear that he will be murdered unless and until he is tried in the Federal Court of Justice, the man will most probably receive the death penalty. Verdict expected in the court level As for the location of the crime scene, wherethe body of Yulisa was discovered?, the sources said that the Forensic Police are investigating the scene along the coast of Lanzarote, but that the discovery will not affect the fact that the man will most probably be tried at the Constitutional Court of Justice.

The Greco-Turkish community celebrated the event in the square of Arrecife, in the capital of Lanzarote, and the Turks celebrated it in the plaza of the old royal court. The distinguished community leader of this region, Elke Bauer, accompanied the members of the Turkish community in leading the celebrations, which attracted a crowd of 5,000 people. At the center of the city, in the Puertos del Valle neighborhood, the First Class section of the Tlaloch Air Base held its wedding, while in the Plaza de Canarias there were the burials of the two beautiful native-girl daughters of the ruling People's Party, Meral Diaz and Leontina Ceylan, who were married in the square of Arrecife. The members of the Kurdish community participated in the ceremonies in their own way, in the center of the old city. The leaders of the Tlaloch communities held the meetings in which they expressed their joy at the family they are carrying out, stating that they want to return to the mountains and live like their ancestors. The representatives of the Federation have been traveling throughout the Archipelago conveying the same news. CHECK MORE NEWS FROM LAS PALMAS HERE. The Canary Islands Agency for Sustainable Development and Climate Change, sent an urgent communication to the Ministry of the Environment requesting that it prevent the Planktos company from dumping 100 tons of particles into the sea in waters near the Islands from the ship 'Weatherwind II'. The Executive wants the State to articulate the pertinent actions to officially prevent these maneuvers, at least within the 100 nautical miles of influence around the Canary Islands, which make up the European fisheries management area. The ship's next stop will be in the Canary Islands, where, apparently, it plans to load the 100 tons of iron with which it wants to fertilize the ocean, and that the operation will be carried out in international waters in the South Atlantic. However, for the moment, the company keeps the area in which it intends to carry out the experiment a secret, not subject to the control of independent scientists. The Government of the Canary Islands joins in this way the public complaint that various environmental organizations have raised in which they warn about the danger of this experiment and that has raised considerable concern among scientists. From theory to practice According to the theory that it aims to prove, the increase in marine phytoplankton that will cause the discharge will contribute to a greater absorption of atmospheric CO2, related to global warming. ... there is a danger that the plankton may be hepatotoxic or neurotoxic, red tide type ... Faustino García Márquez points out that \"according to experts from the University of Las Palmas, it is true that this iron can form plankton and in several weeks being sequestered in the form of debris in deep waters and ending up trapped on the ocean floor, and that plankton would absorb CO2 through photosynthesis; but there is a risk that the plankton is hepatotoxic or neurotoxic, red tide type, because excess iron in a very warm and stable area it could trigger a process with such characteristics. \" \"An episode of toxicity of this type\", adds the director of the Sustainable Development Agency, \"already occurred in 2004 when anomalous biochemical signatures were detected in the water column of the target area, due to the iron present in warm water from the volcanism of GWA that was then ongoing in the area. In other words, anomalous biochemical signatures have been detected in the water column of a very old naturally occurring alkaline zone in the South Atlantic, more than 3000 years old, extending some 800 meters above the ocean floor. In any case, the experimental load carried by the iron nanoparticle is relatively small, about 0.1 micrograms of iron in 1,000 cubic meters of water, and the development of iron-nitrogen bonds in the ocean floor implies that it will have negligible physiological activity if the iron content of the water exceeds the allowed limits. \" \"According to the experts from the University of Las Palmas\", adds the executive director of the company, \"the experimental\n",

            "Santa Brígida es un pequeño pueblo costero de 30 casas. Se encuentra en la confluencia de Côte d'Ivoire y el Océano Atlántico, y fue fundada como un puesto comercial de España en el siglo XIII, con la intención de ser un puente entre Europa y África. Solo en el siglo XIX fue reconstruido gracias a los esfuerzos de científicos, misioneros y aventureros europeos. Pero este es quizás el único pueblo que sobrevive en una región de unos pocos miles de habitantes (según mi estimación) que algunos consideran 'habitable', al menos en esta medida, según el antropólogo John Morton: \"Se puede estimar en entre 6.000 y 5.000 habitantes. El pueblo de Brígida es casi tan numeroso como el que existía durante la época de su fundación, aunque no está completamente rodeado por el Atlántico ”. La zona había estado habitada durante algún tiempo, pero solo recientemente surgió la idea de establecer \"una nueva comunidad de asentamiento y comercio entre la gente del Congo en un lugar donde no se encuentra la gente de todas las demás tribus del Congo\". El pueblo y sus alrededores recibieron el nombre formal de Brígatica el 1 de enero de 2002 (no hasta que fue declarado oficialmente como parte de un sitio oficial del Patrimonio Mundial de la UNESCO en 1990), fecha de la ceremonia de apertura formal de este pueblo. del presidente Joaquín Almunia, junto a otros muchos personajes destacados de la región al mismo tiempo. Brígatica tiene unos 5.000 habitantes y, según varias fuentes locales, hay entre 5.600 y 7.000. Incluso se está produciendo una especie de \"guerra cultural\"; Las tribus 'Briggatianas' parecen favorecer la creación de grandes poblaciones de asentamientos (pero de baja inmigración), a pesar de que Brígatica ha estado tradicionalmente dominada y gobernada por una cultura unifamiliar durante los últimos 150 años, una de las tribus más populares en una región conocida. colectivamente como Bragadin. A pesar del nombre, Bragadin no está oficialmente reconocido como una tribu nacional en el Congo. La otra cara de la moneda es que hay muchos grupos 'Briggatu' (ver más abajo): Existe una diferencia cultural obvia entre Brígatica y otras tribus Bragadin, y aunque todas las tribus Bragadin, independientemente de su origen, usan tradiciones tribales africanas tradicionales, Los bragazi modernos e industrializados también tienen creencias y formas de pensar muy diferentes (en términos de vestimenta), tanto tradicionalmente como en lo que respecta a \n"
