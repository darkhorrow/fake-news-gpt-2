Thus, the first gazpacho, the fish as the main dish and the ice cream for dessert, together with the beer as a favorite drink make up the summer menu for the Canaries. "The summer menu" Beer is the perfect companion for 85 percent of those interviewed. These are some of the conclusions of the opinion study 'The summer menu' prepared by Quota Research for Cerveceros de España. Canaries have been asked what they consider the most popular menu during the summer period, and for lunch and dinner the foods that make up the Mediterranean diet are imposed. As starters, 66 percent of those surveyed choose gazpacho, 54 percent prefer Russian salad and 50 percent choose green salads to start their meal. Main dish As for the main dish, fish occupies the first place with 73 percent of the mentions in this section; Next come paella (70 percent) and meats (49 percent), followed by seafood (43 percent), which closes the circle of the most common foods when the heat arrives. In desserts, ice creams are the number one preference of Canaries (87 percent), followed by seasonal fruits such as watermelon (67 percent) and melon (58 percent), and sorbets (31 percent) . To accompany these dishes, beer has been chosen by the vast majority of Canaries as the ideal drink on the summer menu (85 percent). While the consumption of fresh and light products increases, the interest in the usual "winter" meals decreases, much less palatable at this time of year. For 36 percent of those surveyed, casseroles are no longer among their menu options in summer, as well as stews and legumes for 25 percent and stews, which for 23 percent are not eaten either or take much less between June and August.

"What until now has been a handicap for the archipelago - he asserted referring to the position of the Canary Islands in the mid-Atlantic - we can turn it into a positive element", so that in the coming decades "the Canary Islands increase their investment and export of knowledge in the area ". Rivero also advocated the transfer of knowledge in Education and Health to African countries as a measure to collaborate in their development. Rivero warned that the cooperation and development measures promoted from the Canary Islands are insufficient to alleviate poverty in the area, since "the Canarian company and its extension in the neighboring continent would help African development to a greater extent," Rivero said.

Something that she valued because she - she argued - "if the city gains a reputation for being lucky, the number of tourists will increase." The Minister of the Environment, Cristina Narbona, announced today the dispatch of more air and human resources to Gran Canaria and Tenerife, where the situation is of "extreme alarm", to quell the fires on these islands.

With this initiative "we want citizens to feel the support of the institutions, that they feel that they are not alone," announced yesterday afternoon the President of the Autonomous Government, Paulino Rivero, at an emergency press conference called in view of the seriousness of the fire. that since Friday extends to the peaks of Gran Canaria. An authentic "natural catastrophe", in the words of the president, before which he stressed that it is "important" that citizens know that the Canarian Executive "is going to articulate all the support and aid measures that are necessary to compensate for the damage." He also stressed that the Governing Council will also adopt an agreement "requesting the State Government to approve a decree law with complementary measures" to those established by the Autonomous Community.

Paulino Rivero affirmed that the aforementioned are initiatives that the Government of the Canary Islands adopts "always thinking of people", whose safety he stressed that it must be "the fundamental priority", despite the fact that the damage to our flora, our fauna, our natural heritage ".

Aid The Canarian Government will approve a budget item, the limit of which is not set, although it will be proportional to the damage caused by the fires that affect Gran Canaria and Tenerife, with which it will grant aid to families, agricultural productions, companies and corporations affected. The "emergency" aid that the Canarian Government will grant will go, first of all, to the families affected by the fires, in order to contribute to the recovery of the belongings they have lost. Another line of aid will be directed to the recovery or rehabilitation of the affected houses, the exact number of which is unknown, although the data that the Government is obtaining indicate that "there are many," Rivero said. The City Council of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria will be forced to pay approximately four million euros in compensation due to urban irregularities that have been detected in three buildings whose works were started during past administrations. This is the headquarters of the Higher Police Headquarters, also known as the 'Supercomisaría', the State Library and the Insular I building. The respective judgments issued by the Supreme Court settle the matter in favor of the plaintiffs, who are the neighbors of these properties, and they order the Municipal Corporation to come to the negotiation, since some of the resolutions contained in said sentence are impossible to comply with: the demolition of the three mentioned buildings. The three sentences were handed down several years ago, but the City Council has not complied, given the need to agree with the residents of Luis Doreste Silva streets -the buildings adjacent to the super-police station- and Maritime Avenue, the latter affected by the construction of the State Library and the building where the Cabildo de Gran Canaria has established its administrative units in recent years. Included in the General Plan In the three cases the administrative irregularities coincide, for which the Supreme Court has condemned the City Council, the administration that granted the licenses. However, the three properties have already been legalized by being included in the current General Plan. In the case of the super police station, the oldest of the three, the High Court considered that the modification of the General Urban Planning Plan of 1989 (now that of 2000 is in force) in 1994, to authorize the heights of the building, was not adjusted to right, since it was done after the project.

A 25-year-old Paraguayan young man has been sentenced by the Las Palmas Provincial Court to 8 years and six months in prison for raping a minor at the reception of a hotel in Puerto Rico (Gran Canaria), according to the sentence made public today. The convicted person, Miguel Angel O.P., born in 1982 in Cauasu (Paraguay), and who is in provisional prison for these events, which occurred on September 2, 2006, must also pay compensation of 12,000 euros to his victim. Injuries caused by the struggle The court considers it proven that at 4.30 am on that day the accused was at the reception of the Hotel Greco in Puerto Rico, south of Gran Canaria, when the 16-year-old minor, whom he invited to go to reception with the excuse of cleaning a wound that had been made in the foot. Once inside, Miguel Angel sat next to the minor, began "to kiss her" and "to grab her strongly by the arms, pulled down her pants" and raped her, "despite the resistance of the victim." The court, which does not specify whether the young man worked at the hotel, assures that the minor was raped because she had injuries from "fighting and struggling" with the aggressor, whom he did not know before the events. Therefore, he rejects the defendant's version that it was a consensual act and the defense argument to refute the forensic report that the minor had another sexual relationship "that same night." Consent is ruled out According to the Hearing, the minor's recognition of this relationship "abounds in the verisimilitude of her version", since "it even allows ruling out a second consensual relationship" with the accused, "since the minor already had a person with whom, allow yourself the descriptive expression, satisfy your sexual desires.

The Canary Islands and Cape Verde aspire to build a reference center for the study of bob ace turtles or Caretta caretta after seeing the good results of the collaboration by which hundreds of eggs have been transferred to Fuerteventura, where 200 specimens have been released. The Minister of the Environment of Cape Verde, Madalena Brito, and the Minister Domingo Berriel communicated this during their visit to the Marine Research Center of the Canary Government in Gran Canaria, an institution that carries out the project to reintroduce the turtles in the archipelago . In the Canary Islands this species disappeared hundreds of years ago due to human pressure. The eggs and meat of the loggerhead sea turtle were usually consumed by the canaries, a habit that is still fought in Cape Verde. From Cape Verde, since the collaboration began, about six hundred eggs have been transferred to the Canary Islands to hatch offspring on the islands and, when they are ten or fifteen years old, the females, thanks to their philopatry, return to nest. Newly hatched turtles are eaten even before reaching the sea by birds or mammals and can be grazed by any fish, so they swim non-stop for a day or two until reaching the high seas. Only one of a thousand reaches adulthood, so now they are raised for a year before releasing them, to increase survival to one in a hundred.

These figures reveal the social and economic problems that have arisen in this region and show that the intervention plans continue to fail to the extent that they had been presented in society by the institutions. The Competitiveness Plan still does not receive all the funding committed from the Government of the Canary Islands and the Island Council. Neighbors see how all the promises are now up in the air at the expense of the lawsuits over the new highway, which should have served to attract many investors, laziness when doing business in the area due to economic losses and loss of time that generate the long queues that are registered daily in its road corridor from the municipality of Arucas. The yearbook confirms the impact that unemployment continues to cause for the second consecutive year in the north of the island, where eight out of every hundred residents of the sector do not have a permanent job, which is why it is above the average in the Canary Islands, which is 6.6 percent. The same study places the Canary Islands as the second autonomous community in Spain with the highest unemployment out of the total population. Sustained increase But one of the most worrying data is that the evolution between 2001 and 2006 shows a constant percentage increase in unemployment in the ten municipalities of Gran Canaria. Agaete and Gáldar are the municipalities with the highest percentage of unemployed, with the intermediate entry of Telde and, then, a fourth municipality in the North, such as Guía, which follows in this negative statistic on the labor market in the region. Only Teror and Valleseco are below the Canary Islands average. Just over ten people out of every hundred residents of Agaete are on the unemployment lists, almost three more residents than in 2001. The second municipality of the islands with the same problem is Gáldar, where almost 9% of its inhabitants do not They have a job. CHECK MORE NEWS FROM LAS PALMAS HERE. The Civil Guard has detained in the last hours in Lanzarote and Gran Canaria 59 immigrants, 30 of them minors, and the patron of one of the three nacelles that arrived on these two islands. Although initially 112 raised the number of immigrants detained in the last hours to 56 and the number of minors who were among them to 18, the armed institute has specified in a later statement the details of the three operations carried out in Lanzarote and Gran Canaria, the latter island where more immigrants who have fled after landing are sought. Details of the operations The first nacelle intercepted by the armed institute was rescued by the patrol boat Almirante Díaz Pimienta at around 04.00 hours, when she was sailing one mile from Punta de Los Ancones, in the Lanzarote municipality of Teguise. In this boat were 29 male immigrants from Morocco who were transferred to Puertos Naos, in the capital of the island, where one of them was identified as the skipper of the boat. The rest of the occupants of this patera were made up of 23 adult males and five minors between 14 and 17 years old, all in good health. At the same time that the Civil Guard was acting in Lanzarote, at 04.00 hours, members of the corps moved to the Risco Verde area, in the municipality of Agüimes, where a new boat arrived. So far, the agents of the armed institute responsible for this operation have been able to arrest 13 Maghreb men, six adults and seven minors. The third patera arrived in the last hours to the Canary Islands, specifically to Gran Canaria, was sighted at around 05.15 am in Playa de Vargas, also in the same municipality of Agüimes. They are looking for the escapees This operation, which, like the previous one, is still open, has so far made it possible to arrest 18 "apparently minor" men, 17 of whom are from the Maghreb and one of sub-Saharan origin. Both in Risco Verde and in Playa Vargas (Gran Canaria), the Civil Guard develops a search device to try to locate and detain more immigrants from these last two boats, since it is estimated that they have been able to flee after landing without being detected by emergency services.

The consumers of Tenerife and La Gomera bet on Canarian wine, those of Gran Canaria on the outside. The survey was carried out on a universe of 2,000 people over 18 years of age, and the main objective is "to identify where the wine is consumed, why a certain denomination of origin is chosen, what criteria and which are the ones that consumers choose to time to buy the last bottle of wine, etc. " It was determined that only 15 percent of Canaries consume wine exclusively from the Islands. The survey also indicates that 50 percent of the Archipelago's population drinks wine once or twice a week. The majority of wine consumers are between the ages of 35 and 49, and more than 70 percent of young people surveyed never drink wine. Regarding consumption by status, the medium-low level is the one that consumes the least wine and the medium-high level is the one that drinks it between one and three times a week. By social strata 50 percent, when choosing, bet first on the Denomination of Origin (D.O.) Tenerife and second on La Rioja. When it comes to the social stratum, the lower middle prefers the D.O. from Tenerife, and the upper middle others such as Rioja or Ribera del Duero. La Gomera is the island where they have the most preference for drinking Canarian wine, tied with Tenerife. On the other hand, where they least bet on drinking wine from the Archipelago is in Gran Canaria. Most claim that the last wine was consumed at a meal or dinner and that between three and six euros was spent on the bottle; although one in four spent between six and fifteen euros. They prefer to drink their broths at home, which is why consumption in restaurants has decreased, in part due to alcohol tests. 70 percent of consumers buy wine in supermarkets.

The body of Yulisa Pérez, found dead yesterday in Lanzarote, does not show signs of sexual abuse, police sources reported, who see no signs that her stepfather is guilty of her death despite the accusations of the Dominican group, in which investigations are focused. The autopsy, carried out yesterday on the girl's corpse, reveals that she died of suffocation and, apart from the hands tied behind her back, does not show other signs of violence, beatings or signs of sexual abuse, added Commissioner Antonio Fernández. Yulisa's stepfather, in danger On the other hand, the young woman's stepfather is still in the Arrecife police station to be protected, as he is in danger of lynching, since the young woman's family and her friends point him out as guilty.

The awardees of Castillo del Romeral are still unable to access their houses because of the City Council. The municipal government of San Bartolomé de Tirajana continues without unlocking the work that keeps hundreds of residents of the South in suspense, an urbanization that has been paralyzed for years and that prevents the successful bidders from occupying their homes. Today they gathered again in front of the local Maspalomas offices to demand a solution to the problem. And they did it without making noise, but with large banners that branded the politicians as "useless", while they called on them to go to work "because we already want our house," the claims painted on the sheets read. Not in vain, this conflict has embedded in the administration several mandates, with promises of all kinds that have not been fulfilled.

Then "everything was fixed", denounce those affected.

Soria acknowledged that the tourist market in the Canary Islands has suffered lately, but he is convinced that the Atlantic archipelago continues to be a "very attractive tourist market for the British." The vice president of the Government of the Canary Islands commented that the British financial market has responded in a good way to the crisis in recent months, which shows that this economy has "solid fundamentals". Despite the fact that "consumption has suffered somewhat", the contacts made by the regional government at the London Fair with tour operators and agencies show that the Canarian Archipelago continues to be "an attractive market for the British." Soria also reported that "the sales formulas are changing", since they no longer sell so much through the tour operator directly. "It is being sold more and more through the Internet, more and more it is the direct consumer, the tourist, who goes through the Internet to buy or configure their own package and that must be taken into account. To try to overcome the effects of the outermost periphery and attracting more tourists, the Canary Islands and the United Kingdom are joined by three low-cost companies: Ryan Air, Thomson Fly and Jet 2.

The number of immigrant minors accommodated in the centers of the Canary Islands now exceeds a thousand, the regional Executive announced and revealed that the agreement between Spain and Morocco for the repatriation of unaccompanied minors "is not a sufficient instrument" to be created by the arrival of so many youth and children in recent weeks. The Governing Council summoned the councils and city councils to see if the resources that these institutions have are enough "to give dignified treatment" to all these unaccompanied minors, informed Carolina Déniz, spokesperson for the government body. Likewise, the regional Executive wants to draw the attention of the Government to this situation by holding the Canary Islands Immigration Forum in the near future, which will specifically address the situation of these minors and thus seek to be considered a State problem. Déniz said that the centers are already feeling their "lack of capacity to give a dignified response" to these young people, since it is not only to meet their first needs when they arrive, but to welcome them, educate them and integrate them into the community. Joint solutions The idea when bringing together councils and city councils is to seek joint solutions. They also intend to convene Fecai and Fecam to evaluate the means at their disposal, since the overflow of reception centers can be "aggravated" with the latest arrivals of boats with sub-Saharan and Maghrebian minors. The regional government upon learning the content of the agreement between Spain and Morocco to repatriate minors from that country and complained that the Canary Islands had not been consulted. He also accused the central government for not distributing the minors to the other autonomous communities. CHECK MORE NEWS FROM LAS PALMAS HERE. With the votes of the Canarian Coalition and the Popular Party, Councilor Ángel Llanos succeeded in passing what is now known as the "Llanos Law" which controls the distribution of the free press, arguing that this seeks to avoid more paper collection for cleaning services which would entail more expenses. The opposition voted against this measure and invited the councilor to stop having two bodyguards in favor of collecting paper since the cost of these is almost the same as having this extra protection. The opposition also says that with the "Llanos Law" what is intended is nothing more than curtail freedom of expression. Ángel Llanos justifies the regulation of the expense that he will add to waste management and unfair competition at the Press outlets. In addition, he relies on the implementation of similar regulations in other capitals and on the impossibility of companies "freely occupying the public highway to carry out a lucrative activity." The votes of the Canary Coalition (CC) and Popular Party (PP) allowed the initial approval in plenary session of the restrictions on the free distribution of the Press in the city, which are intended to be introduced as a modification of the Police and Good Government Ordinance, at the proposal of Ángel Llanos, after the entry into circulation of the newspaper "Metro". Gagging and censoring The opposition accused the councilor of attempting to "gag and censor freedom of expression" of a publication "that criticizes the Government Group." But Ángel Llanos said that on the contrary, what he intends is to "encourage, promote and regulate" the distribution of free press, since it is not possible for "companies to freely occupy the public highway to carry out a lucrative economic activity." Councilor Llanos also said that with this he wants to defend the interests of the 345 families that basically live from the profits of the sale in daily newsstands -which he said represents 82% of their income- and of the citizens of Santa Cruz who, as he said, they will have to pay an extra cost in waste treatment of 46,000 euros per year. According to the numbers of Ángel Llanos, whose sources he did not document, some 25,000 free daily newspapers will be distributed in the city, which will generate 1,825 tons of paper per year, which would imply paying 46,000 euros more per year to the Cabildo for its elimination in the PIRS. Against the press The director of the newspaper, Carlos Sosa, present in the plenary session, assures that 5,000 copies are being distributed from Monday to Friday, which accumulates 73,600 kilos of paper per year. Sosa was surprised that Llanos was unaware that the publication is not published on weekends or holidays and wondered where the data he used comes from, considering that if it refers to the global effect of all the informative publications that are distributed in Santa Cruz, "is going against all the Press."

The announcement by Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez to review diplomatic, economic and business relations with Spain could significantly affect Canarian investors in the Caribbean country. According to data from the regional Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Navigation, Canarian businessmen have invested almost 400 million euros since Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chávez came to power in 1998. If the Chávez government launched a campaign to harass women Spanish companies, after the incident at the Ibero-American Summit starring Chávez himself and the King of Spain, who ordered him to shut up, Canarian investment would be affected, not only in the more than 360 million euros already spent, but also in a foreign trade of exports to Venezuela that has exceeded 1,000 million euros in the first six months of 2007. A growing trade Direct investment by Canarian companies in Venezuela has experienced a noticeable decline since the arrival of Chávez to power in 1998, year in which 109 million euros were accounted for in this concept. The fall in investments has been gradual until reaching the ridiculous 230,000 euros of total investment so far this year. The investment of Venezuelan businessmen in the Canary Islands has been increasing as the regime was consolidated. From 86 million euros of Venezuelan money in 1998, it went to 193 million a year later and with a ceiling in 2004, with the arrival of 338 million euros. Since then, and due to restrictions on capital outflows from Venezuela, there has been a drastic cut in investments, reaching 22 million euros invested this year. In a review of relations, those who would fare worse would be the Canary Islands companies. For example, since Chávez came to power, the Canary Islands have imported Venezuelan products worth 36,922 million euros, of which 3,440 million euros correspond to imports in the first six months of the current year. Venezuela sells to the Canary Islands four times more than it buys. CHECK MORE NEWS FROM LAS PALMAS HERE. Many young immigrants affirm upon their arrival in the Canary Islands that they are minors to ensure a different treatment and the possibility of not being expelled, but a simple X-ray of the forearm in hand and their ossification reveals that more than 60 percent are not. The head of Radiodiagnosis of the Maternal and Child Hospital of Gran Canaria, Víctor Pérez Candela, explained that these boys arrive at the center accompanied by policemen with an urgent order from the juvenile prosecutor for a bone test to be carried out. International standard For them, it is important to pass as minors because, instead of being sent to an internment center for their subsequent expulsion, they are sent to a reception center and are protected by the autonomous community, which manages their residence permits. The radiodiagnostic specialist stressed that many of these boys arrive educated, because, even when it is evident that they are of legal age, they insist on the contrary. Thus, in the hospital, an X-ray of the hand is taken from the forearm to the fingers, usually on the left because most are right-handed, and the result is compared with an atlas used as an international standard of skeletal development. The ossification of the bones, the process by which they cease to be cartilage and become visible through an X-ray, is essential to know the age. The specialist studies almost thirty bones, from the ulna and radius to eight of the carpus or wrist, the metacarpals and the phalanges. Without a doubt Although the police are interested in whether they are older or younger than 18 years of age, the doctor indicates the age of the person without margin of error, except in the case that the patient is ill and has had late bone development or accelerated. Men's bones are in a cartilaginous state until they are 19 years old, so if they appear ossified, there is no doubt, they are of legal age, he said. In the case of women, ossification occurs at the age of 17, with which they present more problems because the only certainty is that they are older than that age. At younger ages there is a margin of more or less six months, but it no longer affects the determination of the age of majority. CHECK MORE NEWS FROM LAS PALMAS DE GRAN CANARIA HERE. A firefighters strike in Dakar has made it impossible to transfer a thousand immigrants to their country of origin. The firefighters disabled the runway by crossing the trucks, so that only one of the planes was able to land with 85 immigrants just before the protest began. It was planned to send 500 immigrants from the Canary Islands to Senegal in six planes chartered from Air Europa. Three of the planes were to leave Tenerife and the other three from Fuerteventura. The first took off from Tenerife and arrived in Dakar before the strike began, so it was able to drop off its passengers. Due to the situation that arose, the airport officials decided to turn off the runway lights, so two of the planes that were about to land had to return to the Archipelago, after going around the airport several times, without managing to get off the repatriated immigrants. Bumpy itinerary The other three Air Europa flights did not even take off from the Canary Islands when they were informed of the situation in Dakar. In any case, the Spanish authorities plan to resume repatriation starting this Friday. From Senegal, it was learned that in the last hours only the plane that brought back from France the country's president, Abdoulaye Wade, who had gone to Paris to treat an illness, has landed in Dakar. The two planes that had to return, with about 170 immigrants in total, were presented with an additional inconvenience: they did not have enough fuel to return to the Canary Islands, so they had to stop in Nouakchott (Mauritania) to refuel. Finally, the plane that left Tenerife returned to this island, but the one that had taken off from Fuerteventura had to go to Gran Canaria, because the Majorero airport closes at night. In the end, the 85 immigrants from this last flight were transferred to the La Isleta detention center, which opened its doors this week due to the overflowing of the centers.

The teacher María de los Ángeles Chavanel Seoane was publicly denounced in 2005 by the Association of Mothers and Parents (AMPA) of the Artemi Semidán school located in Arguineguín for alleged bullying. Two years later, the court of First Instance number seven of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria ruled in favor of the teacher, considering that she committed an illegitimate interference in her professional prestige and in her right to honor. "Stories to not sleep" The situation that caused the teacher to sue the AMPA took place on May 31, 2005 when the members of the association sent a statement with the title "Stories to not sleep from the Artemi Semidán school in Arguineguín" to various social media. In the document, they accused the teacher María de los Ángeles Chavanel Seoane of "psychological torture" and school bullying without there being any proof of it, violating her professional prestige, according to the court ruling.

Some 50 homeless people have been evicted from the Oasis Maspalomas palm grove, a protected natural area that borders several first-class tourist establishments, whose interior has become a clandestine refuge for homeless people who live surrounded by garbage. This tourist spot in the south of Gran Canaria is now being cleaned up by the Cabildo and the San Bartolomé de Tirajana City Council after more than 20 years of neglect. The task that cleaning crews face is enormous. After a week of piecework, the bags with palm tree remains, stubble and waste accumulate on the margins of the natural space, waiting for the trucks to begin to remove the mountains of garbage. "This was an uncontrolled landfill in which there was everything except rubble," acknowledges the Councilor for Parks and Gardens, José Rodríguez. Waste of all kinds And it is that they still remain in the place until the chemical toilets that were installed to celebrate a youth camp last summer, with their showers and other objects necessary for coexistence. Dozens of car wheels have also been found, although the most shocking is that homeless settlement. The accumulated dirt in some places motivated the operators to use masks to deal with bad smells without putting health at risk. Furthermore, the state of conservation of the palm grove is lamentable, with many specimens affected by a species of weevil, the diocalandra, which since 1996 silently kills a large part of the plantation. In fact, the large number of leaves that have been removed are related to the attack of this insect, a beetle that is characterized by drilling the palm tree until it is dry and ending with it. More than 200 people participate in the tidying work, most of them hired by the City Council, although the groups of experts in pruning are provided by the Cabildo and the company Elmasa Medio Ambiente. These cutting jobs are mainly focused on the dry parts of the palm trees, since many of them are completely hollow and constitute a danger for those who approach.

This was confirmed by the Minister of Social Welfare, Youth and Housing of the Government of the Canary Islands, Inés Rojas, and the director of the Canary Institute for Women, Isabel de Luis, during the presentation of the campaign and actions planned on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and that coincides with the murder in the south this past Sunday of the last victim. until 2010 Therefore, they showed, on behalf of the Government, their "deepest regret" for this latest death and hoped that with campaigns such as the one presented yesterday "we will not have to continue regretting" this type of event, since gender violence "is the greatest exponent of inequality in our society. " Rojas highlighted the "real effort" of the Canary Islands Government on this issue. According to the counselor, the high number of complaints of mistreatment that occurs in the Islands (3,966 so far this year), placing it as the fourth autonomous community, is due to the fact that women "feel safe" by the Red Canaria of Services and Centers for Attention to Women Victims of Violence, which has an investment of 24 million euros until 2010. The day after The campaign launched by those responsible for the Government of the Canary Islands this year to combat gender violence it focuses on "what happens after" a death has been perpetrated, especially in children, to "gain awareness, rejection and support." Thanks to this network, 9,409 calls have been answered from the 1-1-2 emergency and emergency phone until October, making an average of 31 calls a day. In addition, 279 women victims of violence have been treated in the first semester, while 174 have been taken in.

"I have a luxury hotel in an oasis full of shit," the businessman has denounced on more than one occasion. That comment was recently published in a German magazine specialized in tourism, a few months before the Cabildo de Gran Canaria and the San Bartolomé de Tirajana City Council lined up to combat the dirt in the palm grove. Gerlach's hotel is considered one of the best in the world, a recognition he received in 2005 and which has earned it the five-star luxury category.

Paloma Monte Mayor has been of no use to walk all over Gran Canaria. The protests in front of the regional organizations in charge of seeing for her complaint have been of no use to her. But this has not bent her will, nor has she managed to exhaust her creativity in devising her protests. The last idea Paloma put into practice was to put her legs in concrete and let it set, to get the attention of the authorities and ask for the financial help she needs to rebuild her house, devastated by fire during the fires last summer. After spending all day with his legs inside the concrete, at 8:00 p.m., the firefighters in the capital of Gran Canaria had to intervene and thus prevent him from suffering irreversible damage. Monte Mayor has been protesting before various government bodies, has gathered and delivered all the necessary precautions, and has only encountered "bureaucratic slowness and the incompetence of local administrations." Paloma is one of the many victims of the fires that occurred in Gran Canaria in August of this year. 45-year-old artisan, married and with two children (4 and 9 years old), a neighbor of the Soria ravine, the fire completely destroyed a century-old house that she had in this sector.

The patera arrived after 10:30 am on Tuesday at El Perchel cove, about ten kilometers from Puerto de Mogán, with an undetermined number of people on board but it is estimated that it could be about 20 people. A pregnant woman At first, two women were arrested, one of them pregnant and a minor, while more than a dozen immigrants dispersed through the area. The Civil Guard recognized that the task of finding the rest of the crew would be somewhat "complicated" given that the area is very difficult to access. Several patrols have been forced to leave their vehicles several kilometers from the area and cross it across the country. According to sources, the steepness of the place, which is crowned by cliffs, makes search work difficult, since it must be accessed on foot. However, a few hours later, and despite the difficulties of the search for the orography of the land, 15 more people were arrested, including a 7-year-old boy and another woman. Of Maghreb origin In total, three women, two minors and 12 adult males, all of Maghreb origin, have been arrested for the moment.

The Canary Islands Agency for Sustainable Development and Climate Change, sent an urgent communication to the Ministry of the Environment requesting that it prevent the Planktos company from dumping 100 tons of particles into the sea in waters near the Islands from the ship 'Weatherwind II'. The Executive wants the State to articulate the pertinent actions to officially prevent these maneuvers, at least within the 100 nautical miles of influence around the Canary Islands, which make up the European fisheries management area. The ship's next stop will be in the Canary Islands, where, apparently, it plans to load the 100 tons of iron with which it wants to fertilize the ocean, and that the operation will be carried out in international waters in the South Atlantic. However, for the moment, the company keeps the area in which it intends to carry out the experiment a secret, not subject to the control of independent scientists. The Government of the Canary Islands joins in this way the public complaint that various environmental organizations have raised in which they warn about the danger of this experiment and that has raised considerable concern among scientists. From theory to practice According to the theory that it aims to prove, the increase in marine phytoplankton that will cause the spill will contribute to a greater absorption of atmospheric CO2, related to global warming. ... there is a danger that the plankton may be hepatotoxic or neurotoxic, red tide type ... Faustino García Márquez points out that "according to experts from the University of Las Palmas, it is true that this iron can form plankton and in several weeks being sequestered in the form of debris in deep waters and ending up trapped on the ocean floor, and that plankton would absorb CO2 through photosynthesis; but there is a risk that the plankton is hepatotoxic or neurotoxic, red tide type, because excess iron in a very warm and stable area it could trigger a process with such characteristics. " "An episode of toxicity of this type", adds the director of the Sustainable Development Agency, "already occurred in 2004 in the proximity of the Islands, due to anomalous natural circumstances, but in which the trigger was the iron present in the Saharan dust. In addition, and as other experts have pointed out in the press these days, there is also a danger of an increase in the pH of the water, which could cancel out the beneficial effect of CO2 absorption ".

This Tuesday the Senate approved this Tuesday to extend, in 2008, discounts in the rates of regular air and maritime transport services for residents of the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands, Ceuta and Melilla to regularized non-EU citizens. Initially these discounts were applied only to Spaniards, then they were extended to community residents and from next year regularized non-EU residents will also enjoy them. According to Pere Sampol, these non-EU residents have the same rights and obligations as Spanish or EU residents, since they work and trade in those places and not extending those rates - discounts of 50 percent - constitutes discrimination. We can hardly claim the full integration of these groups when we do not make them part of the rights, Sampol added that "we can hardly claim the full integration of these groups when we do not make them part of the rights that other residents enjoy by virtue of being members. of the European Union". Even though the cost of the measure is estimated at around 10 million euros, the "precarious economic and social situation" of these workers must also be taken into account. In some cases, they are forced to travel to carry out certain administrative procedures to the peninsula. The representative of CC, Félix Ayala, objected, arguing "the economic effort" that he represents for the Government. The PSOE senator Luis Ayllón was of similar opinion and added that "the Commission is not going to amend the plenary session", since in June of last year a similar measure was rejected.

This was announced in a statement by the Canarian Association of Victims of Terrorism (Acavite) on the occasion of a meeting that several of its leaders held today, for the first time in the Archipelago, with the general director of Support for Victims of Terrorism of the Ministry of the Interior, José Manuel Rodríguez Uribes. "Forgotten victims" With Uribes - the organization explains - they spoke of "the work of recognition and aid to the forgotten victims of the 'Sahara Conflict', among others, that have been developing after the launch of this association" . "They have asked for more than 30 years the rights to be recognized as victims of terrorism" An association that was created "with the intention of satisfying and mediating requests for demands on the rights to be recognized as such victims of terrorism, from more than three decades ago, as in the case of civilian workers in the Foss-Bucraa mines and sailors killed, wounded or kidnapped in the Canarian Saharan bank, from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s.

This has been confirmed by the prosecutor Inés Herrero, responsible for the section of Protection of Minors of the Prosecutor's Office of the TSJC. In this center, 17 minors resided in immediate reception, three of whom were foreign girls, and others who had escaped. The number of fugitives could not be specified by the prosecutor, who indicated that the closure order was produced after an ordinary inspection carried out last Monday and yesterday at the center, located in Ojos de Garza, and managed by the non-governmental organization Mensajeros de la Paz after an agreement with the Cabildo. The lack of glass in some windows of the rooms of the center since last September are some of the many deficiencies that were noticed, such as the existence of broken doors, the lack of light bulbs, the electrical wiring to the air, the notable dirt and rusty metalwork. The center lacked adequate furniture such as cabinets for the children's clothing, which was piled up on the floor; study tables; reading books; computers or DVD to carry out education and guardianship tasks. Rubble and garbage in the area The prosecutor added that the food served was deficient and that rubble and garbage accumulate on the land around the property, instead of having a garden area for minors, who have been relocated in other centers of the island. 'Laurisilva' is an immediate reception center, so that the term of stay of minors, once they enter, is three months, although it was exceeded "by far". During those three months, their situation must be assessed to determine whether the family reintegration is appropriate or declare the situation of abandonment. In that case, they are admitted to a reception center, added the prosecutor, who indicated that the Cabildo de Gran Canaria yesterday presented a report to the Prosecutor's Office in which it was stated that the appropriate actions were being taken to adapt a reception center of adolescent minors as soon as possible. SEE HERE MORE NEWS FROM LAS PALMAS DE GRAN CANARIA The Canary Archipelago will be one of the communities most affected, along with Galicia, by the rise in the sea that experts predict will occur throughout Spain as a result of climate change. According to the group of experts, marine waters will rise by 15 centimeters on average between now and 2050, although to the north of the islands it could rise up to 35 centimeters. This is clear from the report Climate change in Spain. State of Situation, prepared by fifteen experts in response to the request made by the President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. The rise in sea level will be noticeable above all, on the Galician cornice and the north of the Canary Islands where up to 35 centimeters above the current level are expected. On the Mediterranean coast, it is estimated that it will increase by 20 centimeters. The new levels will cause a general decline in the beaches, which is estimated to be up to 15 meters in places like the Canary Islands. The experts highlighted the importance of acting in a coordinated way at the global level, but without forgetting national and local actions to combat this global phenomenon. They remind the Government that there are already many policies and instruments available for Spain to comply with its international commitments and adapt successfully to the impacts of this global phenomenon. For experts, climate change is an "irrefutable and unequivocal" fact and some of its impacts are already significant. They insist on the need for a global agreement to act in a coordinated manner. Profitable investment In addition, they coincide with the latest report of the UN Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC) and with the Stern Report, that acting on climate change is "a profitable investment". In this sense, the experts recall that the IPCC pointed out that for every euro invested in mitigation activities, damages worth up to 5 euros can be saved, a figure that the "Stern" report raises to 20 euros. The document also raises the opportunities that the fight against climate change can offer, including reducing dependence on fossil fuels, redesigning spatial planning and improving the quality of life. Experts have also verified the impacts that climate change can have on the coast and the Spanish tourism sector (the coast receives 80 percent of tourism, which is 8 percent of the national GDP), as a consequence of the aforementioned increase in the sea ​​level and the consequent decline of the beaches.
